Most existing trackers based on RGB/grayscale frames may collapse due to the unreliability of conventional sensors in some challenging  scenarios (e.g., motion blur and high dynamic range). Event-based cameras as bioinspired sensors  encode brightness changes with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, thereby providing considerable potential for tracking under degraded conditions.  Nevertheless, events lack the fine-grained texture cues provided by RGB/grayscale frames.  This complementarity encourages us to fuse visual cues from the frame and event domains for robust object tracking under various challenging conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel event feature extractor to capture spatiotemporal features with motion cues from event-based data by boosting interactions and distinguishing alterations between states at different moments. Furthermore, we develop an effective feature integrator to adaptively fuse the strengths of both domains by balancing their contributions. Our proposed module as the plug-in can be easily applied to off-the-shelf frame-based trackers.
We extensively validate the effectiveness of eight  trackers extended by our approach on three datasets: EED, VisEvent, and our collected frame-event-based dataset FE141. Experimental results also show that event-based data is a powerful cue for tracking.
