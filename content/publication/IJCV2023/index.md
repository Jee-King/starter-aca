Most existing trackers based on RGB/grayscale frames may collapse due to the unreliability of conventional sensors in some challenging  scenarios (e.g., motion blur and high dynamic range). Event-based cameras as bioinspired sensors  encode brightness changes with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, thereby providing considerable potential for tracking under degraded conditions.  Nevertheless, events lack the fine-grained texture cues provided by RGB/grayscale frames.
