abstract: Most existing single image super-resolution (SISR) methods continually
  increase the depth or width of networks, without adequately exploring
  contextual features which are essential for reconstruction. Moreover, such
  existing methods pay little attention to the final high-resolution(HR) image
  reconstruction step and therefore hinder the desired SR performance. In this
  paper, we propose a multi-context and enhanced reconstruction network (MCERN)
  for SISR. Specifically, a novel model named Multi-Context Block (MCB) which
  extracts more image contextual features with multibranch dilated convolution.
  Applying multiple MCBs with residual and dense connections, we can effectively
  extract contextual and hierarchical features for obtaining the coarse
  super-resolution result. Then an enhanced reconstruction block (ERB) is
  followed to extract essential spatial features on the high-resolution image to
  refine the coarse result to a better result. Extensive benchmark evaluations
  demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed MCERN in terms of metric accuracy and
  visual effects.
