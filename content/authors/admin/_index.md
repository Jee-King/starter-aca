I received my Ph.D. degree from [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/), Dalian, China, in 2023. In my Ph.D. career, I was supervised by Professor Baocai Yin and [Xin Yang](https://xinyangdut.github.io/). From 2021 and 2022, I was a visiting student at [HLT Lab](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/hlt/), National University of Singapore, Singapore, and supervised by Professor [Haizhou Li](https://colips.org/~eleliha/). Currently, I work at the Information Science and Technology College of [Dalian Maritime University](http://www.dlmu.edu.cn/), Dalian, China, as the 'Xinghai' Associate Professor.

My primary research interests include computer vision and deep learning, mainly focusing on event-based vision and neuromorphic computing.  I am a reviewer for IEEE TIP, TCSVT, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, etc.
